# Cat Or Dog

Python script that classifies whether an image is of a cat or dog

The model is already trained and can be used with the ".h5" file, which is the information learned in the training.

The script "Gato_Cachorro.py" trains the model and can be used with the dataset of choice

The script "Gato_Cachorro_Carregar.py" uses the already trained model to evaluate whether a chosen image is of a cat or a dog
